# 🌐 Social Network Analysis Project – Report

This repository presents a documented case study of a Social Network Analysis (SNA). 

---

## 📘 Project Summary

The primary objective of the project was to develop an interactive, user-friendly platform to analyze social network data and uncover meaningful patterns. Statistical models such as **Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs)** and **Auto-Logistic Actor Attribute Models (ALAAMs)** were applied to understand tie formation and attribute influence.


---

## 🔍 Key Highlights 

- Researched and applied ERGM, ALAAM, and SOAM models for social network simulation and prediction.
- Developed early versions of the ERGM implementation using **R** and later integrated it into **Python** via `rpy2`.
- Designed a modular Streamlit app with a **React + D3.js** frontend for dynamic interaction and visual representation of network structures.
- Implemented **Goodness of Fit (GOF)** testing to validate model accuracy using indegree/outdegree comparisons.
- Delivered insights into how social factors influence interaction patterns and tie formations.
